<h1>Machine Downtime Prediction API</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Machine Downtime Prediction API provides a service for predicting potential machine downtimes based on various features such as temperature, leakage, and electricity usage. This system uses a machine learning model to forecast whether a machine will experience downtime on the following day, empowering businesses to perform preventive maintenance and optimize their operations.</p>

<p>This system is designed for ease of use and efficiency, providing RESTful API endpoints to upload data, train models, and predict downtime with real-time inputs. The predictions help businesses take proactive measures to avoid unexpected downtimes and improve the overall maintenance process.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Upload Dataset:</strong> Users can upload a CSV file containing the historical machine data.</li>
    <li><strong>Train the Model:</strong> Allows training the machine learning model based on the uploaded dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Predict Downtime:</strong> Users can send feature data (temperature, leakage, electricity) for predicting whether the machine will experience downtime.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time Prediction:</strong> Instant predictions for new data sent via API calls.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence Score:</strong> Each prediction comes with a confidence score indicating the likelihood of the downtime.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy Deployment:</strong> Built using FastAPI, making it easy to deploy the service for real-time use.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python (FastAPI, scikit-learn, pandas)</li>
    <li>Machine Learning for downtime prediction model</li>
    <li>FastAPI for creating the API service</li>
    <li>Uvicorn for serving the FastAPI application</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Clone the repository:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/HarikaCheruku/Machine-Downtime-Prediction-API
cd Machine-Downtime-Prediction-API
</code></pre>
<p>Install the dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -r app/requirements.txt</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To start the FastAPI server, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>uvicorn app.main:app --reload</code></pre>
<p>This will start the FastAPI server, and you can access the API at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a>.</p>

<h2>API Endpoints</h2>

<h3>1. Upload Dataset</h3>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> /upload</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> POST</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Upload a CSV file containing the machine data (columns like temperature, leakage, electricity, etc.).</p>
<pre>curl -X POST -F "file=@your_dataset.csv" http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload</pre>

<h3>2. Train the Model</h3>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> /train</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> POST</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Train the model with the uploaded dataset. Ensure the dataset is uploaded before training the model.</p>
<pre>curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/train</pre>

<h3>3. Make a Prediction</h3>
<p><strong>URL:</strong> /predict</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong> POST</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Send a JSON object with features to predict machine downtime.</p>
<pre>curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"Min_Temp\": 12.5, \"Max_Temp\": 32.1, \"Leakage\": 1.5, \"Electricity\": 8.5}"</pre>

<h2>Example Responses</h2>

<h3>For /predict endpoint:</h3>
<p>If the prediction is "No" downtime with 100% confidence, you will receive the following response:</p>
<pre>
{
  "Downtime": "No",
  "Confidence": 1.0
}
</pre>

<p>If the prediction is "Yes" downtime with a different confidence score:</p>
<pre>
{
  "Downtime": "Yes",
  "Confidence": 0.85
}
</pre>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Incorporate additional features to improve the prediction accuracy, such as maintenance history and machine type.</li>
    <li>Extend the prediction model to handle a broader range of machine-related factors.</li>
    <li>Provide a web-based interface (Streamlit or similar) for interactive predictions.</li>
</ul>
